# KASM Language Server

A language server for the [KASM programming language](https://github.com/newcomb-luke/kOS-KASM) within the [kOS](https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS) mod for Kerbal Space Program. A language server can provide features typical to an IDE for the targeted language, in this case Kerbal Assembly Language.

This Visual Studio Code extension currently only provides syntax highlighting, which is useful in its own right, but someday may support code checking.
